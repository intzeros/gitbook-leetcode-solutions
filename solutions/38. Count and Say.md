## LeetCode 38. Count and Say

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221

```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n*, generate the *n*th term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        n--;
        string pre = "1";
        while(n--){
            string str = "";
            int i = 0;
            while(i < pre.size()){
                char pre_c = pre[i];
                int cnt = 1;
                while(i+cnt < pre.size() && pre[i+cnt] == pre_c) cnt++;
                str += to_string(cnt*10+pre_c-'0');
                i += cnt;
            }
            pre = str;
        }
        return pre;
    }
};
```
