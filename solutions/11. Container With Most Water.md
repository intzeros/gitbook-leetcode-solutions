## LeetCode 11. Container With Most Water

Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an*, where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

贪心。le, ri指针从两端往中间走，并且height更短的那条先走。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int le = 0, ri = height.size()-1, ans = 0;
        while(le < ri){
            int area = min(height[le], height[ri]) * (ri-le);
            if(area > ans) ans = area;
 
            if(height[le] < height[ri]) le++;
            else ri--;
         }
         return ans;
    }
};
```
